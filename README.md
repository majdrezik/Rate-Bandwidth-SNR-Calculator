# Rate-Bandwidth-SNR-Calculator
 A simple app that calculates: maximum rate, bandwidth and signal to noise ratio - given two variable. 

### The Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem in information theory determines the maximum rate at which data may be sent over a communications channel with a given bandwidth in the presence of noise. The noisy-channel coding theorem is applied to the classic example of a continuous-time analog communications channel with Gaussian noise.
